# Machine-Learning
The aim is to develop proposals for intelligent models for real problems of moderate
complexity in the field of Classification or Regression. Datasets suitable for training
will be identified (or created) and prepared; Features Engineering will be carefully
explored and applied accordingly; the model(s) that best fit the defined success
criteria will be chosen; its evaluation will justify the selection and, if necessary,
improvements actions should be taken; pipelines will help automate and speed up
the process, and the combination of models will have to be considered. Finally, the
application of the model will be tested. It is also intended to contribute to the production and documentation of clean source code, and the writing of complementary
reports is expected.

• Consolidate the concepts of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Algorithms;
• Analyze real problems;
• Develop programming skills in python;
• Enhance experience in the development of intelligent models;
• Assimilate the content of the course unit.
